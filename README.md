1. Transfer camera feed from plane to Computer:
  [] Open RaspberryPi to SSH to create working environment from PC.
  [] Configure RaspberryPi and T-Beam to communicate.
  [] Make T-Beam a serial transfer over RF (This will make it so I don't need to change code in the T-Beam to change my protocols and such).
  [] Read camera feed from RaspberryPi.
  [] Create protocol and transfer over T-Beam.
  [] Create parser and home PC.
